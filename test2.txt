4. Add marinated meat (or vegetables) and cook until it's browned.
5. Add spices, salt, and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil.
6. Add the soaked rice and mix gently.
7. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked.
8. Serve hot, garnished with fresh coriander and lemon wedges.
